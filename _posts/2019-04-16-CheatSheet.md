### Cheat sheets
This is a personal cheat sheet that I may or may not maintain.  
It's a start.  I'm hoping that this will be useful for myself
and for others.  I'll admit it, it's unlikely.

#### OS/X
Show Hidden Files in Finder - `Command + Shift + .`

#### Markdown

1. Links - `[linked text](url)`
1. Block Quote - `> block quote.`
